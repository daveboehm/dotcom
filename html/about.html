	<div>
		<p>Thirty-something year old web developer in Austin, TX. Pretty good with Angular 1.x, jQuery and command line. Loves working with talented designers, passionate UXers, and anyone that cares about accessibility. Turn offs are deadlines, Bears fans, and codebase compromises.</p>

		<p>Outside the office I like to be left alone, take corny pictures with my dog, watch football, drink craft beers, fail at woodworking, and be terrible at video games. Suppose I enjoy coding too. Challenge me to a coffee drinking competition if you like to lose.</p>

		<p>Take a look at my <a href="#/resume">résumé</a> if that's your thing, creep on my <a href="https://github.com/daveboehm">Github</a>, follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/pocketconfetti">Twitter</a>, or send me a <a href="#/contact">message</a> if you must. <a href="http://www.pocketconfetti.com">Pocket Confetti</a> is my portfolio (sort of - most things I do can't be displayed publicly). Go take a look!</p>
